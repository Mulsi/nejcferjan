    "aboutText": "Nejc Ferjan spent all of his 34 years in Slovenia, most of them on the slopes of the Slovenian Alps, where he tried to fulfil his love for snowboarding. It  eventually turned into a career as brands started to notice his freestyle snowboarding skills. Many injuries later snowboarding had subsided, but that chapter of his life never really closed as he started to gain interest in photography. His first camera was the one he borrowed from his dad, which he used for taking pictures of his friends snowboarding and skating. Trying to make a living, working in a steel factory earned him enough money to buy his own camera and some photography equipment. He had luck to be mentored by, in his opinion, by one of the most influential sports photographers in the world, Samo Vidic. In the beginning of 2021 he decided to quit his job at the steel factory and focus on photography as his main career.",
