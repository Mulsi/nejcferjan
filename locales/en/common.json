    "aboutText": "I am Nejc Ferjan, from Slovenia, where I have spent all of my 34 years. Most of them were spent in the slopes of the slovenian Alps trying to fulfill my love for snowboarding. It eventually turned into a career as brands started to notice my freestyle snowboarding skills. Many injuries later snowboarding had subsided, but that part of my life never really ended as I have started to gain interest for photography. The first camera was the one I have  borrowed from my dad to take pictures of my friends snowboarding and skating. Trying to make a living, working in a steel factory earned me enough money to buy my own camera and some photography equipment. I have had luck to be mentored by, in my opinion, one of the most influential sports photographers in the world Samo Vidic.  In the beginning of 2021 I have decided to quit factory job and  make photography my main career.",
